![Truck Detection Demo](link_to_demo_video.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning YOLO models (YOLO-NAS, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5) for accurate truck detection in CCTV videos. The project explores the potential of computer vision and deep learning to enhance security and monitoring applications using real-world CCTV data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from actual CCTV cameras, providing a diverse and challenging set of images and videos for training and evaluation. It includes various lighting conditions, unpredictable weather variables, and a wide range of truck types.

## Project Highlights

- **Fine-Tuned Models**:

    - **Part 1: YOLO-NAS Results**: We present the results of fine-tuning YOLO-NAS for truck detection in the first part of our video.

    - **Part 2: YOLOv8 Results**: The second part showcases the results of fine-tuning YOLOv8 for accurate truck detection in CCTV videos.

    - **Part 3: YOLOv5 Results**: The final part of our video demonstrates the impressive results achieved with YOLOv5.

- **Video Demonstration**: Watch our full video demonstration to witness the power of these fine-tuned YOLO models as they accurately detect trucks within complex CCTV footage, even under challenging conditions.
